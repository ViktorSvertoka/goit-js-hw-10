# Acceptance criteria

- `goit-js-hw-10` repository created.
- In your submitted homework, there are two links: One to your source files and
  one to your working page on `GitHub Pages`.
- During live page visits, there are no errors or warnings generated in the
  console.
- Project built with
  [parcel-project-template](https://github.com/goitacademy/parcel-project-template).
- Code formatted with `Prettier`.

## Start files

In the [src folder](./src), you will find start files. Copy them to your project
completely, replacing the `src` folder in
[parcel-project-template](https://github.com/goitacademy/parcel-project-template).
To do this, download this entire repository as an archive or use the
[DownGit service](https://downgit.github.io/) to download a separate folder from
the repository.

## Task - country search

Create a front-end part of the application to search for information about
countries by their partial or full names. Check out the
[demo video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17479434/131147741-7700e8c5-8744-4eea-8a8e-1c3d4635248a.mp4)
of the app.

### HTTP requests

Use the public API [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.com/), namely
[resource name](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-name), which returns
an array of country objects that match the search criteria. Add at least some
decoration to the interface elements.

Write a function, `fetchCountries(name)`, that makes an HTTP request to
[resource name](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-name) and returns a
promise with an array of countries - the result of your request. Move it to a
separate file called `fetchCountries.js` and make a named export.

### Field filtering

The back-end returns objects with some properties most of which you do not need.
To reduce the amount of data transferred, add a string of request parameters -
this is how this back-end implements field filtering. Check out the
[filter syntax documentation](https://restcountries.com/#filter-response).

You only need the following properties:

- `name.official` - full name of the country
- `capital` - capital
- `population` - population
- `flags.svg` - link to flag images
- `languages` - array of languages

### Search box

The user enters the name of the country to search for in the `input#search-box`
text field. HTTP requests are made by typing the country name, that is, on the
`input` event. However, you cannot make a request every time a key is pressed,
since many requests will be made at the same time, and they will be executed in
an unpredictable order.

It is necessary to use the `Debounce` technique on the event handler and make an
HTTP request `300ms` after the user has stopped typing text. Use the
[lodash.debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.debounce) package.

If the user clears the search box completely, the HTTP request is not executed,
and the country list markup or country information disappears.

Sanitize the entered line using the `trim()` method, which will solve the
problem when there are only spaces in the input field or at the beginning/end of
the line.

### Interface

If the back-end returns more than 10 countries, a notification appears in the
interface saying that the name should be more specific. For notifications, use
the [notiflix library](https://github.com/notiflix/Notiflix#readme) and display
this line: `"Too many matches found. Please enter a more specific name."`.

If the back-end returns from 2 to 10 countries, a list of found countries is
displayed under the text field. Each list item consists of a flag and country
name.

If the request results in an array with one country, the interface displays the
card markup with information about the country: flag, name, capital, population
and languages.

> ⚠️ It is enough for the app to work for most countries. Some countries, such
> as `Sudan`, can be problematic because the name of the country is part of the
> name of another country, `South Sudan`. Do not worry about these exceptions.

## Error handling

If the user enters the name of a country that does not exist, the back-end will
return not an empty array, but an error with the status code `404` - not found.
If you do not handle this, the user will never know that the search has not
returned any results. Add a notification, "Oops, there is no country with that
name"`, in case of an error using the
[notiflix library](https://github.com/notiflix/Notiflix#readme).

> ⚠️ Remember that `fetch` does not treat 404 as an error, so you need to
> explicitly reject the promise in order to catch and handle the error.
